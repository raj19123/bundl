			<p> BUNDL takes very seriously the private nature of your personal information. The privacy of all BUNDL users is very important. This Privacy Policy describes our policies on the collection, use, and disclosure of information about you in connection with your use of our services, including those offered through our websites, emails, and mobile applications (collectively, the "Service"). The terms "we", "us", and "BUNDL" refer to BUNDL, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company with its headquarters in Washington, DC. When you use the Service, you consent to our collection, use, and disclosure of information about you as described in this Privacy Policy. It is designed to help you understand how we collect and use the personal information you decide to share. Please read this notice carefully and do not hesitate to let us know if you have any questions.<br><br>

Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will generally post any Privacy Policy changes on this page and notify you via email of any significant changes.<br><br>

<strong>How We Collect And Use Your Information </strong><br>
We may collect and store information about you in connection with your use of the Service, including any information you transmit to or through the Service. We use that information to provide the Service’s functionality, fulfill your requests, improve the Service’s quality, engage in research and analysis relating to the Service, personalize your experience, track usage of the Service, provide feedback to third party businesses that are listed on the Service, display relevant advertising, market the Service, provide customer support, message you, back up our systems, allow for disaster recovery, enhance the security of the Service, and comply with legal obligations. Even when we do not retain such information, it still must be transmitted to our servers initially and stored long enough to process.</p>
<p><br>
    
    <strong>In particular, please note the following:</strong><br>
    
     <strong>Privacy Policy needs to clearly explain what data the app is collecting about the users:</strong><br>
	 
	<strong> Identifiers: </strong>
Includes direct identifiers, such as name, user ID, username or unique personal identifier; email address, phone number, address and other contact information; IP address and other online identifiers; tax ID and other and other unique identifiers.<br>
<strong>Customer Records: </strong>
Includes personal information, such as name, account name, user ID, contact information, employment information, and financial or payment information, that individuals provide us in order to purchase or obtain our products and services. For example, this may include information collected when an individual register for an account, purchases or orders our products and services, or enters into an agreement with us related to our products and services.<br>
<strong>Commercial Information:</strong>
 Includes records of personal property, products or services purchased, obtained, or considered, or other purchasing or use histories or tendencies.<br>
<strong>Usage Data: </strong>
Includes browsing history, clickstream data, search history, access logs and other usage data and information regarding an individual's interaction with our websites, mobile apps, and our marketing emails and online ads.<br><br>

     <strong>How we are processing the data, the purpose of the app processing that data:</strong><br>
 In general, we may use and disclose the personal information we collect for the following business and commercial purposes:<br>
•	Providing and supporting our services<br>
•	Supporting collaboration, networking, and projects<br>
•	Communicating with you<br>
•	Marketing and advertising<br>
•	Personalizing content and experiences<br>
•	Analyzing and improving our services<br>
•	Protecting bundldesigns, you, and others<br>
•	Complying with legal obligations<br>
•	In support of our general business operations<br>
<br><br>
     <strong>Delete your information:</strong> Our Services and related documentation give you the ability to delete certain information about you from within the Service. For example, you can remove content that contains information about you using the key word search and editing tools associated with that content, and you can remove certain profile information within your profile settings. Please note, however, that we may need to retain certain information for record keeping purposes, to complete transactions or to comply with our legal obligations.<br><br>
     <strong>Request that we stop using your information:</strong> In some cases, you may ask us to stop accessing, storing, using and otherwise processing your information where you believe we don’t have the appropriate rights to do so. For example, if you believe a Services account was created for you without your permission or you are no longer an active user, you can request that we delete your account as provided in this policy. Where you gave us consent to use your information for a limited purpose, you can contact us to withdraw that consent, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place at the time. You can also opt-out of our use of your information for marketing purposes by contacting us, as provided below. When you make such requests, we may need time to investigate and facilitate your request. If there is delay or dispute as to whether we have the right to continue using your information, we will restrict any further use of your information until the request is honored or the dispute is resolved, provided your administrator does not object (where applicable). If you object to information about you being shared with a third-party app, please disable the app or contact your administrator to do so.<br><br>

    <strong>Account Information:</strong> If you create a BUNDL account, we may store and use the information you provide during that process, such as your full name, email address, zip code, and other information you may provide with your account, such as your gender, phone number, and birth date. We may publicly display your first name and last initial, as well as any photo or other content you submit through the registration process, as part of your account profile and in connection with any public reviews you submit. You can modify some of the information associated with your account through your profile on BUNDL. If you believe that someone has created an unauthorized account depicting you or your likeness, you can request its removal by contacting us at info@BUNDL.co.<br><br>
    
    <strong>Activity:</strong> We may store information about your use of the Service, such as your search activity, the pages you view, the date and time of your visits and check-ins, and purchases you make through the Service. We also may store information that your computer or mobile device may provide to us in connection with your use of the Service, such as your browser type, type of computer or mobile device, browser language, IP address, WiFi information such as SSID, mobile carrier, phone number, unique device identifier, advertising identifier, location (including geolocation, beacon based location, and GPS location), and requested and referring URLs. We may also receive and store your location whenever our mobile applications are running, including when running in the background, if you enable our mobile apps to access such information in the course of using the Service. You may be able to limit or disallow our use of certain location data through your device or browser settings, for example by adjusting the "Location Services" settings for our applications in iOS privacy settings.<br><br>
    
    <strong>Public Content: </strong>Certain of your contributions to the Service are intended for public consumption and are therefore viewable by the public, including your photos, ratings, reviews, and edits to venue listing information. Your account profile (e.g., first name, last initial, and profile photo) is also intended for public consumption. You can limit the public nature of some of these activities through your profile settings.<br><br>
    
    Other users may be able to identify you, or associate you with your account, if you include personal information in the content you post publicly. You can reduce the risk of being personally identified by using the Service pseudonymously, though doing so could detract from the credibility of your contributions to the Service. BUNDL users can also use the Crew feature to find one another based on their email addresses. You can adjust the settings for this feature in your account settings in the BUNDL app.<br><br>
    
    <strong>Contacts:</strong> You can invite others to join or become part of your crew on BUNDL by providing us with their contact information, or by allowing us to access your contacts from your computer, mobile device, or third party sites to select which individuals you want to invite. If you allow us to access your contacts, we may transmit that information to our servers long enough to process your invitations.<br><br>
    
    <strong>Communications: </strong>When you sign up for an account or use certain features, you are opting to receive messages from BUNDL. BUNDL will generally allow you to choose to not receive certain types of email communication from us, except for those that are absolutely necessary. Emails will generally contain a link at the bottom to be removed from our mailing list. Additionally, you can manage some of your messaging preferences through your profile settings, but note that you cannot opt out of receiving certain administrative, transactional, or legal messages from BUNDL. For example, if you change your password, we may send you a notification confirmation that your password was changed for security reasons, including through automated SMS text messages to your phone number. We may also track your actions in response to the messages you receive from us or through the Service, such as whether you deleted, opened, or forwarded such messages. If you exchange messages with others through the Service, we may store them in order to process and deliver them, allow you to manage them, and we may review and disclose them in connection with investigations related to use of the Service, as well as our efforts to improve the Service. We may not deliver messages that we believe are objectionable, such as spam messages, fraudulent solicitations, or requests to exchange reviews for compensation. If you send or receive messages through the Service via SMS text message, we may log phone numbers, phone carriers, and the date and time that the messages were processed. Carriers may charge recipients for texts that they receive. We may also store information that you provide through communications to us, including from phone calls, letters, emails and other electronic messages, or in person. If you are a representative of a business listed on BUNDL, we may contact you, including by phone or email, using the contact information you provide us, make publicly available, or that we have on record for your business. Our calls with you may be monitored and recorded for quality purposes.<br><br>
    
    <strong>Transactions:</strong> If you initiate a transaction through the Service, such as a check-in or purchase of a #WHPH Pass, we may collect and store information about you, such as your name, phone number, address, email, and payment information (such as a credit card number and expiration date), as well as any other information you provide to us, in order to process your transaction, send communications about them to you, and populate forms for future transactions. This information may be shared with third parties, and third parties may share such information with us, for the same purposes. When you submit credit card numbers, we encrypt that information using industry standard technology. If you write reviews about businesses with which you transact through the Service, we may publicly display the fact that you transacted with those businesses. For example, if you check-in through the Service and write a review about your experience, we may publicly display the fact that you made you checked-in through the Service.<br><br>
    
    
    
    <strong>Different Devices:</strong> You may access the Service through different devices (e.g., your mobile phone or desktop computer) and different platforms (e.g., the BUNDL website or BUNDL mobile app). The information that we collect and store through those different uses may be cross-referenced and combined, and your contributions through one BUNDL platform will typically be similarly visible and accessible through all other BUNDL platforms.<br><br>
    
    
    
    Facebook, Google, Instagram, and Twitter Integrations
    If you sign up for, or log into, BUNDL using a third party service like Facebook or Google, or link your BUNDL account to your account with a third party service like Facebook, Instagram or Twitter, we may receive information about you from such third party service. If you post content to a third party service through the Service, that third party service will also receive that content, which will be visible to anyone that has access to it through that third party service. We will not view or store any data available to us from your third-party profile without first presenting you with the option to choose for us to not view or store it. Please note that your use of the Service may not be able to be integrated with such third-party profiles unless you opt-in to sharing certain information (for example, your name, email address, and age) from the third-party profile with BUNDL.<br><br>
    
    
    
    Cookies, Web Beacons and Unique URLs:
    Like most sites and apps, BUNDL makes use of cookies, web beacons, tags, scripts, local shared objects such as HTML5 and Flash (sometimes called "flash cookies"), advertising identifiers (including mobile identifiers such as Apple’s IDFA or Google’s Advertising ID) and similar technology (collectively, “Cookies”) in connection with your use of the Service. Cookies may have unique identifiers, and reside, among other places, on your computer or mobile device, in emails we send to you, and on our web pages. Cookies may transmit information about you and your use of the Service, such as your browser type, search preferences, IP address, data relating to advertisements that have been displayed to you or that you have clicked on, and the date and time of your use. Cookies may be persistent or stored only during an individual session. BUNDL will never use cookies to retrieve information from a computer that is unrelated to our Services.<br><br>
    
    <strong>Third Parties:</strong><br><br>
    
    <strong>Certain third parties may receive information about you as follows:</strong><br><br>
    
    <strong>Aggregate or Anonymous Information:</strong> We may share user information in the aggregate with third parties, such as businesses that are listed on BUNDL and content distributors. For example, we may disclose the number of users that have been exposed to, or clicked on, advertisements. We may also disclose anonymized information about your use on BUNDL, for example if you engage in a transaction in connection with BUNDL, we may publicly disclose information about the transaction without providing identifying information about you or otherwise disclosing your participation in the transaction.<br><br>
    
    
    <strong>Service Providers: </strong>We may rely on third party providers to support or provide some of the services that are available through the Service, such as sms texting. We may also rely on third party providers to perform certain services for us in connection with your use of the Service, such as communications and hosting services, network security, technical and customer support, tracking and reporting functions, quality assurance testing, payment processing, our own marketing of the Service, and other functions. We may share information from or about you with these third party providers so that they can perform their services or complete your requests. These third party providers may share information with us that they obtain from or about you in connection with providing their services or completing your requests. Third party providers may also share this information with their subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control.<br><br>
    
    <strong>Investigations and Legal Disclosures:</strong> We may investigate and disclose information from or about you if we have a good faith belief that such investigation or disclosure: (a) is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process and law enforcement instructions and orders, such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, judicial proceeding, or other legal process or law enforcement requests served on us; (b) is helpful to prevent, investigate, or identify possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service; or (c) protects our rights, reputation, property, or that of our users, affiliates, or the public. If you flag or otherwise complain to us about content through the Service, we may share the substance of your complaint with the contributor of that content in order to provide an opportunity for the contributor to respond.<br><br>
    
    <strong>Business Transfers:</strong> We may share information from or about you with our subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control, in which case we will require them to honor this Privacy Policy. If another company acquires BUNDL, or all or substantially all of our assets, that company will possess the same information, and will assume the rights and obligations with respect to that information as described in this Privacy Policy.<br><br>
    
    <strong>Minors</strong><br>
BUNDL does not knowingly collect any information from persons between the ages of 13-20. If we determine that any content has been displayed on our site by someone under the age of 13, it will be removed. If you are under the age of 21, we request that you please leave BUNDL immediately.</p>

<p><strong>Deletion of data</strong><br>You can ask us to completely delete your data related to our website and related to facebook as well. Send us email to info@bundldesigns.com and send us your email or username. This will remove completely data related to login with facebook and all other data.<br>
    <br>
    
    <strong>Closing Your Account </strong><br>
    You can close your account by clicking the “Deactivate BUNDL Account” tab under the “More” menu of the BUNDL app. We will remove certain public posts from view and/or dissociate them from your account profile, but we may retain information about you for the purposes authorized under this Privacy Policy unless prohibited by law. For example, we may retain information to prevent, investigate, or identify possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service or to comply with legal obligations. Please note that businesses cannot remove their business listings, ratings, or reviews by closing their accounts.<br><br>
    
    <strong>Our Security Precautions</strong><br>
    We take security concerns very seriously. We use commercially available means to ensure that sensitive personal and financial information is encrypted. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or via mobile device, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.<br><br>
    
    <strong>Links To Other Websites</strong><br>
    The Service may contain links to other websites. BUNDL is not responsible for the privacy practices of third parties or the content of these websites. Except as set forth herein, we do not share your personal information with them. We recommend you read the privacy policies on or applicable to all such third party websites.<br><br>
    
    
    
    <strong>Advertisers:</strong> We may allow third parties to use Cookies through the Service to collect the same type of information for the same purposes as we do. In doing so, we adhere to the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising. Third parties may be able to associate the information they collect with other information they have about you from other sources. We do not necessarily have access to or control over the Cookies they use, but you may be able to opt out of some of their practices by visiting the following links: Network Advertising Initiative,Omniture and Digital Advertising Alliance. Please note that opting out does not prevent the display of all advertisements to you. Additionally, we may share non-personally identifiable information from or about you with third parties, such as location data, advertising identifiers, or a cryptographic hash of a common account identifier (such as an email address) to facilitate the display of targeted advertising. You may be able to limit our sharing of some of this information through your mobile device settings or through the Service’s settings.<br><br>
